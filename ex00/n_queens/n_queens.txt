Chess composer Max Bezzel published the eight-queens puzzle in 1848.

Franz Nauck published the first solution in 1850. Nauck also extended the puzzle to the n queens problem, with n queens on a chessboard of n x n squares.

This is how Nauck described the problem:

The Eight Queens Problem:

One of the classical problems connected with a chess-board is the determination of the number of ways n 
which eight queens can be placed on a chessboard, or more 
generally, in which n queens can be placed on a board of n^2 cells so that no queen can take any other.
