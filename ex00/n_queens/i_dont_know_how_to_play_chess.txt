A chessboard is an array of size 8x8 (in this exercise we consider boards of size nxn).

A queen is a piece which can be on any square of the board. A queen can take another piece if that piece is on the same row, on the same column or on the same 45 degrees diagonal line.

For example on the following board, the queen Q can take pieces A, B or C but not D or E.
